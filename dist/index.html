Hereâ€™s how it works in detail: 1. **Input**: Users upload a Microsoft Word document (*.doc or *.docx* format), which may contain text, images, and mathematical equations. 2. **Processing**: - The application parses the document, reading and extracting each component. - Text data is organized and structured into JSON objects. - Images are converted into data URIs or linked file paths, then embedded within the JSON. - Equations are extracted and either stored as images or translated into a math markup language like MathML or LaTeX. 3. **Output**: - The resulting JSON structure mirrors the layout and content of the original document, making it easy to reuse or manipulate the data programmatically. - This JSON data can be used for applications requiring structured text, media content, and math equations in a machine-readable format. This tool is ideal for developers who need to standardize document content for use in web applications, testing, or data processing systems.</noscript> <div id="root"></div> </body></html>
